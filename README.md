# TryMakeGame-GodotEngine-Pt1
Written in: 5/9/2025 (5th September 2025)

## A Bit of My Chit Chat
Hello-hello. There's Evan The Developer.

Since I decided to start learning game development, I try to make my initial move with Godot (you can check it [here](https://godotengine.org/)) with AI guiding.

And, since it using AI, so think it's not a huge deal if I make this repository a public one. Hopefully, my documentation can giving you insight as a newbie programmer alike me. Big hug for you all, guys :3

### The Godot I use
It's Godot Stable Mono version (or .NET version) v4.4.1.

As a note, .NET/Mono version is supporting you for C# scripting throught .NET/Mono framework, in addition to GDScript. If you want this version too, make sure you have .NET installed, at least v8 or above. Download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

### Steps to Starting With Godot
1. Download Godot. Check the link above.
2. Download the latest .NET version. It's better to use the latest version. Check the link above.
3. Locate your Godot zip, extract it on your desired location.
4. Run Godot. It does not need any installation (as how portable application usually goes).

## My Initial Try: DVD Animation Copycat
This is our goal, but we'll use the Godot icon to make it easy for beginner.

If you try to check the code, there's no trace since I forgot to commit this initial (heheh, sorry). So, here's the tutorial.

### Step 1: Create Your Own Project
I named my project itself as "trylearnbygeminiai.pt1" so name it as you desired.

### Step 2: Create A Scene
1. In the Scene dock (Top-Left), click Add (`+`).

![AddingNewNode](/documentation-assets/part-1-assets/AddingNewParentNode.png)

Choose the `Node2D` option.

![ChoosingNodeType](/documentation-assets/part-1-assets/ChoosingNodeType.png)

This will create a `Node2D` as the root of your scene.
2. Right-click the `Node2D`

![RightClickOnNode](/documentation-assets/part-1-assets/RightClickOnNode.png)

and select `Add Child Node`.
3. Search for `Sprite2D` and create it. This node is used to display a 2D image.

### Step 3: Add The Sprite's Texture
1. Select the `Sprite2D` node int the Scene dock.
2. In the **Inspector** on the right, you'll see a property called `Texture`.
3. In the **FileSystem** dock on the bottom-left, you'll see the default `icon.svg`.

![IconSvgOnRes](/documentation-assets/part-1-assets/IconSvgOnrRes.png)

Drag this file onto the `Texture` property slot in the Inspector.

![TextureOnInspector](/documentation-assets/part-1-assets/TextureOnInspector.png)

You should now see the Godot icon in the center of your viewport.

4. Save your scene by pressing `Ctrl+S` (or C`md+S`). Name it something like `main.tscn`.

### Step 4: Write The C# Script
1. Select the `Sprite2D` node again.
2. In the **Inspector**, check a property called `Script`. Click on dropdown icon.

![MakeNewScript](/documentation-assets/part-1-assets/MakeNewScript.png)

Click `New Script...` to attach a new script.

3. In the pop-up, set the **Language** to `C#`. The path and name should be fine. Click `Create`.

4. Write down this script and save it (press `Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`):
```
using Godot;

public partial class Sprite2d : Sprite2D
{
	private Vector2 _velocity = new Vector2(250, 200);
	
	public override void _Ready()
	{
		GD.Print("Sprite is ready!");
		Position = GetViewportRect().Size / 2;
	}
	
	public override void _Process(double delta)
	{
		Rect2 viewportRect = GetViewportRect();
		
		Position += _velocity * (float)delta;
		
		if (Position.X < 0 || Position.X > viewportRect.Size.X)
		{
			_velocity.X *= -1;
		}
    
		if (Position.Y < 0 || Position.Y > viewportRect.Size.Y)
		{
			_velocity.Y *= -1;
		}
	}
}
```
### Step 5: Run The Program
1. Click the Play button (or press `F5`) at the top-right.
2. Godot will ask you to select a main scene. Choose the `main.tscn` you just saved.
3. Your game window will appear, and you should see the Godot icon bouncing around!

There's the final result:

  <summary>Code Explanation</summary>
  <u>First Part</u>

  ```
  using Godot;
  ```
  
  Since you write the script on C#, this line can be used to calling Godot's core logic (importing Godot Engine classes and functions) to be implemented on your script.

  <u>Second Part</u>

  ```
  public partial class Sprite2d : Sprite2D { }
  ```
  
  The `partial` keyword is C# feature, and Godot use it to link your script with its own generated code behind the scenes, making things like signals work. Also, it's declared Sprite2D just because it's a script written for your 2D object (the moving Godot logo). Just it.
  
  <u>Third Part</u>

  ```
  private Vector2 _velocity = new Vector2(250, 200);
  ```
  
  A Vector2 object is holding two values: X and Y. It's perfect for 2D object positioning, direction, or velocity. So, `_velocity` here declared to store the 2D object speed and direction.

  <u>Fourth Part</u>

  ```
  GD.Print("Sprite is ready!");
  ```
  
  Printing a debugging message to the output console. You can assume it as printing HelloWorld on every programming language. Use it when you need to print some debugging messages.

  <u>Fifth Part</u>

  ```
  Position = GetViewportRect().Size / 2;
  ```
  
  The default positioning of Godot is (0,0) which mean your object will be located on the top-left of the screen. So, we need to set up the initial position of the object on the center of the screen.
  
  `GetViewportRect().Size` will give you the screen boundaries, the current size of the game window (width and height). Divide it with `/2` will make the object placed on the center of the screen.

  <u>Sixth Part</u>

  ```
  public override void _Process(double delta){ }
  ```
  
  The `_Process()` function is called on every single frame. To make it easy, let's say it as the "object core logic". We add `delta` as the input, which it is was the time elapsed since the last frame, ensuring smooth movement.

  <u>Seventh Part</u>

  ```
  Rect2 viewportRect = GetViewportRect();
  ```
  
  As the earlier, we'll use it to get the screen boundaries. We'll use it to make the bouncing logic below.

  <u>Eighth Part</u>

  ```
  Position += _velocity * (float)delta;
  ```

  We will update the object position based on its velocity and the frame's delta time.
  
  <u>Last Part</u>

  ```
  if (Position.X < 0 || Position.X > viewportRect.Size.X)
		{
			_velocity.X *= -1; // Reverse horizontal direction
		}
  ```

  We use it to check is the object hit the left or the right edge of the screen. If it so, `_velocity.X` will be inverted to make it visually seems bounce horizontally.

  `Position.X < 0` refer to the hit on the left edge.

  `Position.X > viewportRect.Size.X` refer to the hit on the right edge.

  And, the same is goes on the vertical edge.

  ```
  if (Position.Y < 0 || Position.Y > viewportRect.Size.Y)
		{
			_velocity.Y *= -1;
		}
  ```

  `Position.Y < 0` refer to the hit on the top edge.

  `Position.Y > viewportRect.Size.Y` refer to the hit on the bottom edge.

Now, you was making a DVD animation copycat with Godot icon.

To knowing further my script about it, you can check it on [Sprite2d.cs](/trylearnbygeminiai.pt1-dvdanimationcopycat/Sprite2d.cs) of DVD Animation Copycat subproject.

Let's step ahead to my second try.
